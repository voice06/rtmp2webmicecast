rtmp2webmicecast
================

Simple PHP script that uses rtmpdump and ffmpeg to convert a rtmp stream into the webm format for distribution to icecast servers.

Use by executing 'php main.php'

This was just something I made over about an hours and a half time, it will not daemonize, you will need to run this in a screen session.
